* Add more functions that might be useful.  Perhaps some more financial functions, functions that
  are widely used in spreadsheet applications, etc.
* Add support for a list of expressions, and some associated functions....
  ex: sum({2,4,5,7}) = 18
* Maybe change flex and bison to use c++ instead of C (?)
